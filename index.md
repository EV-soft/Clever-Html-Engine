Build dynamic html pages with php functions.

Dynamic PHP to HTML generator.
If you program html output in php, you can use this library's routines to generate the html code, by calling PHP-functions.
    
ELEMENTS:
Create HTML elements INPUT / CHECKBOX / RADIO-GROUP / TABLE and other usefull, from PHP-functions.
All combined with: Label, ToolTip/Hint, Placeholder, Dimensions, Colors and more.

Included translate system, to all the user interface strings. 

Font-awesome icons, to be shown with all labels.

Extended table functions: sort, filter, zebra-stripe, fixed-header and more, with Mottie Tablesorter-system.
    
Based on PHP7+/PHP8+, HTML5, CSS3.
Source could be UTF-8, no tabs, indent: 4 chars

The layout is compact with labels above fields, so it is suitable to narrow screens or windows.

All shaded labels have a tooltip/hint, that appears when mouse is held over.

Look at the *.page.php files to see how it works.

Minimum file needs: php2html.lib.php, and a few in _assets folders, or from CDN-servers.
